description: Analyze staged changes and generate a conventional commit message that accurately describes the what and why of your changes

Provide a commit message that concisely summarizes the staged changes. Do not run git commit. Do not mention yourself in the message (no co-author statement). Provide it in a codeblock. Long sentences should not be split with newlines.
