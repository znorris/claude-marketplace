description: Generate a concise commit message for staged changes. Use when the user wants a commit message or asks "what should I commit this as?"

Provide a commit message that concisely summarizes the staged changes. Do not run git commit. Do not mention yourself in the message (no co-author statement). Provide it in a codeblock. Long sentences should not be split with newlines.
